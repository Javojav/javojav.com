# **WARNING!** proceed at your own risk

If you are seeing this repository for whichever reason, I would strongly advise to **leave as soon as possible**, **as doing otherwise could have serious consequences on your health.**

## What is all this trash?

At some point in my life I decided that coding could be fun and/or useful (I'm making this up. I don't remember what happened, however this is not the important part at all). Fast forward, I decided to learn JavaScript (I know it was a mistake (idk everyone hates JS)) because websites are cool or something idk. 

Anyway, at that time 14 y/o me had (obviously) no idea about coding and life in general.

The outcome of all that is what you can see on this repository which is just a big mess of unreadable code that makes no fucking sense. 

Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot of stuff and had fun, however the code I wrote was the worst thing ever. 

## Does this apply to any of your other repos?

Yes, however this is probably the worst one.

## If the code is so bad why didn't you delete it?

I don't know, I am scared of deleting stuff.

## Will you rewrite this and make something acceptable out of it, or at least make your code non hazardous for my health?

Probably not. Honestly I started doing that 1 or 2 years ago, however I didn't (and probably will never) finish.

Who cares about all this stuff anyway? 

## I did have a look at this code and... I got [insert your favorite disease], my hamster got crazy, my dog died etc...

Well that's your problem... I mean... I did warn you...

It's like being a smoker and being surprised that you got lung cancer... Like... wow... How could that possibly happen?  

## I understand that you were just young and dumb... perhaps, my code looked more or less the same when I started coding

Thanks for your understanding and have a great day.
